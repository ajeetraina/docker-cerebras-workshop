# Basic Agent Interaction

Learn the fundamentals of interacting with your multi-agent system.

## Exercise 1: First Contact with the Main Agent

Test basic communication with the multi-agent system:

- Open the web interface at http://0.0.0.0:8000
- Try the following sample interaction:

```
Hello I'm Phil
```

**Expected Outcome**: DevDuck should respond and introduce the system capabilities.

```
Hello! I'm DevDuck, your main development assistant and project coordinator. How can I assist you today? If you have a question that is more suitable for my specialized agent, Cerebras, or Local Agent, I can transfer your question to them. Let me know if you need help with advanced computational tasks, complex problem-solving, general development tasks, or project coordination.
```
