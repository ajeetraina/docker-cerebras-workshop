# Next Steps

Continue your journey with multi-agent systems.

## Extending the System

After completing this workshop, consider:

1. **Adding New Agents**: Integrate additional specialized agents for specific domains
2. **Custom Models**: Experiment with different local and cloud models
3. **Enhanced UI**: Build more sophisticated user interfaces
4. **Integration**: Connect with external development tools and IDEs
5. **Monitoring**: Implement comprehensive logging and monitoring solutions
