# Best Practices

Production-ready practices for multi-agent systems.

## Development Workflow

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with basic queries to understand agent capabilities
2. **Progressive Complexity**: Gradually increase task complexity as you learn the system
3. **Agent Specialization**: Use Local Agent for standard tasks, Cerebras for complex analysis
4. **Context Management**: Be clear about what you want each agent to focus on

## Performance Optimization

1. **Resource Management**: Monitor container resource usage
2. **Network Efficiency**: Keep agents and compose services on the same network
3. **Caching**: Leverage Docker layer caching for faster rebuilds
4. **Scaling**: Consider horizontal scaling for high-demand scenarios

## Security Considerations

1. **API Key Protection**: Never commit API keys to version control
2. **Network Isolation**: Use Docker networks for secure inter-agent communication
3. **Access Control**: Implement proper authentication for production deployments
4. **Regular Updates**: Keep dependencies and base images updated
