# Agent Routing

Master the art of directing conversations to specific agents.

## Exercise: Agent Navigation

Practice directing conversations to specific agents:

1. Direct communication to Local Agent:

```
I want to speak with Local Agent
```

2. Switch to Cerebras:

```
I want to speak with Cerebras
```

3. Return to coordinator:

```
go back to devduck
```

**Expected Outcome**: The system should seamlessly route your requests to the appropriate agents.
