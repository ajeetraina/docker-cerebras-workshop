# Welcome to DevDucks Multi-Agent Workshop

!!! tip "Workshop Duration"
    Approximately 1-2 hours of hands-on learning

Welcome to a Docker DevDucks Multi-Agent workshop that will guide you through building and deploying a Multi-agent system using Docker, Google Agent Development Kit (ADK), and Cerebras AI.

## What You'll Learn

In this hands-on workshop, you will:

- **Build and deploy a multi-agent system** using Agentic Compose
- **Understand how to orchestrate multiple AI agents** for specialized tasks  
- **Learn to integrate Cerebras AI with local models** for enhanced programming assistance
- **Master Docker containerization** for AI agent coordination
- **Explore FastAPI web interfaces** for agent interaction
- **Practice with real-world Node.js programming scenarios** using AI agents

## Workshop Structure

This workshop consists of both theoretical concepts and practical exercises designed to give you hands-on experience with:

### üéº Agent Orchestration
Learn how Docker Compose coordinates multiple AI agents in a unified system.

### ü§ñ Multi-Agent Communication  
Understanding inter-agent messaging and intelligent request routing.

### üíª Local and Cloud AI Integration
Combining local models with Cerebras cloud services for optimal performance.

### üåê Web Interface Development
Building user-friendly interfaces for seamless agent interaction.

## Real-world Applications

Throughout this workshop, you'll work with practical Node.js development assistance scenarios that demonstrate the power of coordinated AI agents in software development:

- Code generation and explanation
- Complex problem-solving for Node.js applications
- Project coordination and development planning  
- Code analysis and optimization suggestions
- Testing strategy development
- Educational programming assistance
